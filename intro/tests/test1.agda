-- this is the first test I run
-- Its been a while since i used my brain, @KMx404

module test1 where

data 𝕟 : Set where
  --zero : 𝕟 --its not practical to do so, we can use more efficient math formulas
  suc : 𝕟 → 𝕟  -- since We have the value of zero => n, any next item succ will consider it as n.num
  _+_ : 𝕟 → 𝕟 → 𝕟 -- Defining addition? I guess (wtf is guess? haha) 
 -- zero : zero
  --zero + zero = zero 
  --zero + 𝕟 =  𝕟 -- Zero has no effect in addition
